PURPOSE
  To create, read, update, and delete files from a knoweledge base consisting of:
    -Common_Tools
    -Developer_Tools 
    -Linux_Tools 
    -Windows_Tools 

  Each of these "tool boxes" contains information to conduct a task or an actionable script (automated) that can be selected to carry out a task.   

DETAILS
  -Python will be used so that the tool can be ran anywhere as long as the script 
  is in its special directory containing the directories it needs to operate on
  -This will be a command line driven application, where starting the process opens 
  a terminal window 
  -the window will display a series of options:
  c|reate r|ead u|pdate d|elete e|xecute
  -unfortunately for now, the execute command will only start processes that have  
  been developed outside of the software and stored in its directories 
  no configuring of executables or scripts will be allowed just yet
  -should detect os (can still read from other os though)

  -later on, implement adavanced queries that is something like a search engine
  -perform statistics on certain items 
  -should be left to easily add onto in terms of running other programs from it 
  or in it
