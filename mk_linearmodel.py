# linear regression on mongodb stock market data using machine learning and a restful api 
# Predict: Profit Margin given (ROA, IT, SG, and SR) 
# schema of stock companies contating roughly 78 different factors of the company ranging from the Ticker symbol to the 50-day moving average. The plan for extracting the data goes as follows:
#  1. select a variable of interest that will be used for prediction.
#  2. select potential predictors (no more than 5) that will be used to train a linear model that 
#  will predict the feature of interest.
#  3. use the function framework created with pymongo and the restful api to extract data to be used
#  in a sample that will train the model 
#  4. prepprocess the data and train the model 
#  5. use the trained model as a function that can recieve an input on suitable predictors and 
#  make a fairly good prediction on the outcome.  
# package: 
#  "Profit Margin", 
#  "Return on Assests", 
#  "Insider Transactions", 
#  "Short Ratio"
